The analysis for identifying maternal versus fetal fragments for case 3 was done
out of band with the rest of the analysis. It uses the same Snakemake directory,
working in a user-created subdirectory, 'matFetFrags'.

The scripts assume the user has installed correctly samtools, picard, and R w/
the Rsamtools, data.table, and stringi packages.

The analysis can be repeated as follows:

1. Use the 'informativeSites.R' script to identify the sites with unique
   maternal or fetal heterozygosity. (creates 'infomrativeSites.bed')
2. Run 'runPileup.sh' creating a pileup containing query names (read names) for
   each site in 'informativeSites.bed' (creates 'informativeReads.pileup')
3. Extract and separate reads from 'informativeReads.pileup' with
   'subsetReads.sh' (creating 'maternalReads.txt' and 'fetalReads.txt')
4. Subset reads from the filtered set ('keep/keep/FES-0034-4.keep.bam'), into
   'maternalReads.bam' and 'fetalReads.bam' using 'subsetReads.sh'
5. Create the c3MatFetReads object using 'c3MatFetReads.R' script
